#files: python only maintains two categories of files, text and binary
# text files are also known as flat files or ascii files
#structured data is like an excel file, semi structured is like emails because it still have specified tags but its a little unstructured and then instructured data is no torganized and its like having a foledr with audio files or images: all of these combined is what is called big data
