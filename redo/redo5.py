#files: python only maintains two categories of files, text and binary
# text files are also known as flat files or ascii files
#structured data is like an excel file, semi structured is like emails because it still have specified tags but its a little unstructured and then instructured data is no torganized and its like having a foledr with audio files or images: all of these combined is what is called big data

#plain files: each data is tored as a separate line so we dont need separators
#flat files: each data value is separated by a separator

#different type of separators: comma-separated value which is separated by a comma, character-separated value which is separated by a comma, semicolon or tab, a delimiter-separated valyue which destincts a row or rows in a table, or a tab-separated value which is a type of dsv and its formatted as a table when in the text file
